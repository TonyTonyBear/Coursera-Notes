#Supervised Learning
-Supervised Learning occurs when we have an answer to the problem we are teaching to the machine. More formally, it is when we have an expected output to train our inputs to reach.

-There are two types of supervised learning problems:
1. Regression
2. Classification

##Regression
-Regression problems are defined as prediction of an output that is within continuous results. This means that theoretically, we can map any value of our problem to a formula. The computer is then trying to determine what that formula is.

##Classification
-Classification problems deal with predicting a value that is within discrete (separate) results. In other words, the computer is trying to categorize inputs into separate, distinct outputs.
